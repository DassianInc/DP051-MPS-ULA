#### ULA MPS Sencha Shell

This branch is meant to get the developer setup with the exact sencha framework
used along with other supporting depedencies. This project was not setup traditionally
and work would need to be done to get it hooked up to using npm or bower for dependency management.

* Pull this branch into a folder other than the location
where development will take place or planned to take place.
* Create development folder and copy all files from senchaShell branch manually to development location either before or
after initially pulling dev branch itself.
  * Note that the gitignore file in dev branch will prevent the modification of files in senchaShell for the most part.
